# Overview

This repo creates some front-end demo of a batch betting system across multiple sports betting platforms.

For each betting platform our system controls many separate user accounts.  On trading opportunities we may send the same bet with different amounts to
selected accounts for the same platform.

# UI description

## Account view

In many different interfaces (account management, betting management) we will be listing accounts available.

For each account we always display

- holder full name
- cash balance
- betting limits, only for limited accounts

The following info will also be indicated graphically

- phone offline: make the entire icon/avatar grey
- on hold: use something like maybe 🚫
- potentially colored tags 

When the mouse hovers over an account, we display more info like

- backup cash in the bank
- custom notes

When we right-click an account, we can opt to edit

- cash balance
- betting limits
- whether it is on hold
- custom colored lables
- custom notes

## Account management view

For each platform, display the logo, and list associated accounts as described above.
