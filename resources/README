# Overview

This repo creates some front-end demo of a batch betting system across multiple sports betting platforms.

For each betting platform our system controls many separate user accounts.  On trading opportunities we may send the same bet with different amounts to
selected accounts for the same platform.

# UI description

## Account view

In many different interfaces (account management, betting management) we will be listing accounts available.

For each account we always display

- holder full name
- cash balance
- betting limits, only for limited accounts

The following info will also be indicated graphically

- phone offline: make the entire icon/avatar grey
- on hold: use something like maybe 🚫
- potentially colored tags 

When the mouse hovers over an account, we display more info like

- backup cash in the bank
- custom notes

When we right-click an account, we can opt to edit

- cash balance
- betting limits
- whether it is on hold
- custom colored lables
- custom notes

## Account management view

For each platform, display the logo, and list associated accounts as described above.

## Batch betting view

### Before bets

When we enter the betting view, we already know the platform, the game, and the market we are betting on.  There is odds associated,
but we can optionally override it.

At this point all accounts for this platform should be listed, sorted by bet size (=min(available cash, limit)), with on-hold and offline accounts
put at the very last.

The right-click and edit feature should be the same here.

Now we should be able to select accounts and specify bet size for each of them.

On top we display total bet size that live updates.

We have two modes for entering bet sizes:
- Individual mode: Select an account and enter its bet amount (original behavior)
- Distribution mode: Select multiple accounts, enter a total amount, and click "Distribute" to automatically distribute the total across selected accounts. After distribution, bet amounts can still be customized individually.

Click a "send all" button to get these bets sent.

### After bets

Now no bet size should be editable.  Only the accounts for which bets are sent should be in one focused area.
For each bet sent, we display the amount, and the current status.  Consider using the WhatsApp like logos
for status:

- sent to phone: grey single check mark
- acked by phone：green single check mark
- phone succeeded making the bet: green double check mark
- phone failed: red cross

Real-time update a total succeed amount out of total bet, like $3500 / $5000

If we hover over failures we should be able to see error messages returned by phone.
