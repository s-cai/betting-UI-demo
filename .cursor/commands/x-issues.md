# x-issues

Go through current open issues for the repo at https://github.com/s-cai/betting-UI-demo/issues
one by one, in ascending order of issue number.

For _each_ issue:
1. **Record start timestamp** using `Get-Date` (PowerShell) or equivalent before starting work
2. Work on the issue
3. Verify in browser
4. Commit after verification
5. **Record end timestamp** using `Get-Date` (PowerShell) or equivalent after committing
6. **Calculate and store** the actual wall clock time (end - start)

At the end, summarize changes and push all commits. **Include actual measured wall clock time** (not estimates) for each task in the summary - just the duration, no need to mention exact times in the summary.
